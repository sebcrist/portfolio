  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>
    I'm a computer engineering student based in Montreal, with a strong interest in hands-on tech, systems design, and collaborative projects. Whether it’s coding, tinkering with hardware, or working on group builds, I enjoy creating practical solutions and learning by doing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over the years, I've worked in varied roles, from research and assembly to customer service, and each experience has helped me become more adaptable, detail-oriented, and collaborative. I value diverse perspectives and enjoy working in multilingual environments.
  </p>

  <p>
    Im currently working as a Software Engineer Intern at Wirewerks, where I'm developing a web application to streamline the management of test results from their products.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside of work and studies, I’m into biking, hiking, camping, car mods, hockey, and exploring new places.
