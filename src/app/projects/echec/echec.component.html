    <p>
      This project was a fun and valuable learning experience. One of the main challenges I encountered was due to poor initial planning of class interactions. I found myself stuck between keeping all the movement logic for every piece in a single, bloated file or restructuring the design entirely since breaking the logic into individual piece classes caused circular dependencies. With the project already well underway and code quality not being graded, I chose to push forward as-is. It taught me an important lesson about the value of early architectural planning to prevent technical debt and maintain scalable, clean code.
